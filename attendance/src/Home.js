          <h2>The University of Professional Sciences</h2>
          <p>
            As a traditional university it offers a range of courses, broken down into modules over years of
study.</p>
<p>
Each module delivery is considered as an occurrence and involves a teaching team (e.g.,
module leader and tutors) together with a cohort of students.</p>
<p>
Teaching sessions can be broken down into full cohort sessions (e.g., lectures) or group-based sessions (e.g., lab-based tutorials
with limited capacity), which means that a single cohort may be divided into several groups.</p>
